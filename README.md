Files for 'It Has A Squid In It'. Python 2.7/Pygame 1.91

Only two playable stages right now, then it quits back to the title menu. The art is also obviously not complete.

Just run 'main.py' to start.

Controls: Use the mouse to move Vampy around the screen! Ink bullets are fired automatically. Keyboard controls are included, but aren't as responsive and will probably be removed.

This game is also designed to work with Pygame for Android, but this version has not been tested yet. If running in Android, the squid is controlled by the accelerometer

To Do: Cutscenes, including a tutorial cutscene explaining the controls.
